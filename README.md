### When to use this instead of firebase
See the table below to campare clorabase and firebase with their features.

| Usage                     | Clorabase | Firebase |
| -----------               |-----------|----------|
| Large storage (>10GB)       | Yes       | No      |
| Large database (>512MB)         | No        | Yes      |
| Unlimited push notification| Yes        | No      |
| In-app messaging         | No        | Yes      |
| In-app update             | Yes        | Absent   |
| Authentication             | Absent | Yes|

The rule of thumb is, if you’re building a small project or dedicated mobile application, and you don’t mind the high bandwidth or database storage, Clorabase is a great place to start. If you’re looking for a more general-purpose data solution, value performance at scale and advanced querying, Firebase is going to serve your needs best.
