# Contributing to Clorabase

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Clorabase! It's because of people like you that this project can be what it is today.

We welcome all types of contributions, from reporting bugs and suggesting new features to writing code and improving documentation.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create a detailed issue on our GitHub repository. A good bug report should include:

* A clear and descriptive title.
* The steps to reproduce the bug.
* The expected behaviour.
* The actual behaviour.
* Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We're always looking for new ideas! If you have a suggestion for an improvement or a new feature, please open an issue and use a clear title like "Feature Request: [Your feature idea]". Describe your idea in detail and explain why you think it would be a valuable addition to Clorabase.

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions, especially for the items on our current to-do list. Before you start writing code, please check our open issues to see if someone else is already working on the same feature or bug.

#### Getting Started

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  Create a new **branch** for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix`.
4.  Make your changes, following the coding style and conventions.
5.  **Commit** your changes with a clear and concise message.
6.  **Push** your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7.  Open a **Pull Request** from your branch to our `main` branch.

#### Current To-Do List

This is a list of high-priority tasks we are actively working on. If you're looking for a place to start, these are great options:

1.  **Improve In-App Messaging:** Enhance the SDK to support more conditional logic for sending messages.
2.  **Enhance In-App Updates:** Improve the feature in both the Console app and the SDK.
3.  **Improve Error Handling:** Refine error handling in both the Console app and SDK. We need to add better abstraction and make exceptions more clear and easy to debug.
4.  **Develop Login UI & Flow:** Create the user interface and logic for the login flow in the Console application.

## Community

If you have questions or want to discuss a feature, you can open a new issue or comment on an existing one. We appreciate your patience as we are a small team and may take some time to respond.

We look forward to your contributions!
