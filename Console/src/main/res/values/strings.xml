    <string name="app_description">Clorabase is a free and backend alternative for android apps. Clorabase is mostly made for apps
        which hardly requires online node and other android backend features. Although, this can also be used for the hybrid apps which often
        uses node and other features but considering firebase for that will be more beneficial. As the limits or quota are based on the assumption
        that the app will not fully depend on the server. The biggest advantage of using this instead of firebase for small apps is that you don\'t have
        to build an account in order to use clorabase. Yes, this service does not need account.
